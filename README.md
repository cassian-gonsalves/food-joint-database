# Database Design for small food Joints - MySQL

Designed a Database system for small food joints such as Boston Shawarma while I was studyin Data management and Database Design course at Northeastern University to store the following details
-   Details of the employees who work at the joint along with their payroll and designations
- 	Customer Information (Basic personal details, Order etc.)
- 	Order Information
- 	Combos

Depending on the above data we can View the following data
- 	Payroll Details
-	List of Customers/Employees etc.

This is just a basic design that I implememented in MySQL workbench to get clear with database concepts.

**How to run**
1. Install MySQL work bench
2. Import the database or run the queries in dump.
